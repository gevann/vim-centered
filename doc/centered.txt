INTRODUCTION                                    *centered*

This plugin provides centering (actually offsetting from the left) of the current vim-split.

There are two options, centering with a scratch buffer populated with your .org file of choice, or centering with an empty buffer.

CENTER AND SHOW SCRATCH PAD

*cnt*
cnt       Toggle centering, reading g:centered_scratch_pad file into the offset buffer

CENTER WITHOUT SCRATCH PAD

*cnn*
cnn       Toggle centering without reading a file into the offsetting buffer.
